This project contains a [Play Scala](https://www.playframework.com/) based 
implementation of the [Atlassian Connect](https://connect.atlassian.com/) framework. 
It serves as a starter for building Atlassian Connect add-ons for JIRA and Confluence.

## Quick start

atlassian-connect-play is published to Maven Central for Scala 2.13 and Play 2.6.x, 
so you can just add the following to your build:

    libraryDependencies += "io.toolsplus" %% "atlassian-connect-play" % "x.x.x"

## Basics

You can generate a fresh project by cloning the seed project, which will provide 
you with the basic project structure. Alternatively if you have an existing Scala 
project, you can manually add a the framework dependency to your project to turn 
it into an Atlassian Connect add-on.

### Creating a project from the seed project

The easiest way to get started is by cloning the [Atlassian Connect Play Seed](atlassian-connect-play-seed) 
project.

## Responding to requests
 
### Requests from an Atlassian Host

### Requests from the add-on


## Making API requests to the product

### Send requests as the add-on

atlassian-connect-play will automatically sign requests from your add-on to an 
installed host product with JSON Web Tokens. To make a request, inject an 
`AtlassianConnectHttpClient` object into your class.
Then call `authenticatedAsAddon(url)` with a relative URL. Make sure you have a 
implicit instance of `AtlassianHost` available in the calling function. It is 
required to sign and determine the absolute URL for the outgoing request.

    class RestClient @Inject()(httpClient: AtlassianConnectHttpClient) {
   
        def fetchIssue(issueKey: String)(implicit host: AtlassianHost): Future[WSResponse] = {
            httpClient.authenticatedAsAddon(s"/rest/api/2/issue/$issueKey").get
        }
    }

### Send requests as a user

Not yet implemented.

## Authenticating requests from iframe content back to the add-on

The initial request to load iframe content served by the add-on is secured by 
JWT, as described above. However, add-ons often need to make authenticated 
requests back to the add-on from within the iframe. Using sessions is not 
recommended, since some browsers block third-party cookies by default. Also, the 
JWT token issued by the Atlassian host cannot be used for other requests to the 
add-on since it contains the `qsh` (query-string hash) claim.

Instead, add-ons can use the JWT *self-authentication token* - provided by 
atlassian-connect-play. 
Pages (iframes) rendered by a add-on may include a meta tag containing an 
initial self-authentication token.

    <meta name="token" content="@token">
 
A client-side script can easily extract the token
 
    document.head.querySelector("[name=token]").content
 
and use it to sign the request back to the add-on. Whenever possible, e.g. for 
AJAX requests, the token should be sent in the Authorization HTTP header:

    beforeSend: function (request) {
        request.setRequestHeader("Authorization", "JWT " + token);
    }
You can also send the token in the `jwt` query parameter:

    <a href="/protected-resource?jwt=...">See more</a>
    
Add-ons may respond to client-side requests with refreshed token provided in the
Authorization HTTP header. You may save the refreshed token for the next request
back to the add-on.
